                <p>
                    The Charter Logo is the key embodiment of brand identity. We imagined the Charter Compass as the symbol of what it is we do on a daily basis: help people navigate post-acute care.
                    Whether that be the payors and providers who need to know their patients are in good hands after discharge from the hospital or acute care setting, or whether that be the patients
                    and their families navigating the intricacies of post-acute and/or end-of-life care journies - we're there to help.

                    <h5>The Compass symbol</h5>
                    <p>
                        The Charter Compass takes the primary shape of a 'C' for Charter, while tactfully baking in the face of a compass and a compass needle. This symbol is simple, inspired by some very
                        famous minimalistic logos, like Apple, Target, Google, etc.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Color Scheme</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our final logo color scheme is a play on a complementary color theory system, but with some tweaks to fine tune it as a proper derivative of our color palette. Our vibrant pink accent
                        stands out and hearkens to the old Charter pink color scheme, while the light and dark navy blues tie in common colors from the healthcare industry.

                    <h5>Logo Text</h5>
                    <p>
                        The logo text uses the Dosis font family with a 10% kerning (space between letters). The capitalization was chosen to convey authority and establish a context of strength and reliability. 
                        The font color differs between the dark navy and the white depending on the background use case for maximum accessibility. The 'healthcare' font is in our classic Charter pink
                        primary accent for brand recognition and for a feeling of compassion and comfort.
