                    Our form component currently implements a mix of the Alt Light theme and the Dark theme (see <a href='https://charter-official-prototype.netlify.app/' target='_blank' rel='noopenner noreferrer'>charterhcg.com</a>).
                    It currently takes the form of a class component as the basis of the component was imported from FormSpree.io, the email handling service API that this form utilizes.

                    <h5>Hidden 'gotcha' field</h5>
                    <p>
                        The last input on the form is a hidden field named <span className="code-span">_gotcha</span>. This input is a special spam-fitlering configuration. When FormSpree.io receives
                        a submission through this form in their API, it checks for this field. If this field is filled out the API will know it was a web-scraping bot and it wll filter the submissionm,
                        since no end-user can see that input and thus no humans are filling it out.
